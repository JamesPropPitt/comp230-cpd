# Weekly Reports
For my own benefit I have added a unique counter this term to track my levels of anxiety throughout the weeks
0 = Anxiety free!
10 = Unable to leave the house
Henceforth 
Anxiety Score = AS
Anxiety Attack Counter = AAC
## Week One
### AS: 4
### AAC: 0
This week we presented our world pitches to the teams we have been assigned to for the year. As with every presentation I do, I didn't do any preparation or have any notes whatsoever I went in and did it off the cuff. I feel as though this is easier for me as if I go through the preparations for it then it makes it seem like a big thing which i need to get right, but if I don't worry about preparing then I don't worry when presenting. Which I know is unusually backwards, but oh well, works for me.

## Week Two
### AS: 2
### AAC: 0
Brian's lectures are just like, what?
They seem to be diving into the complex parts of the subject very quickly and I'm not having a chance to keep up, or maybe I'm just dumb?
Michael's sessions on the moral and ethical standpoint was quite interesting, finding out that I'm an exceptionist and learning about what that means. Useful for the ethics essay.

## Week Three
### AS: 0
### AAC: 0
Nothing particularly interesting happened this week, although Al made us pair up and ask each other questions about a game we had selected to analyse the interface for, SpaceChem by default. This was useful as it not only explained how to handle heuristical analysis but also why it's a good idea.

## Week Four
### AS: 2
### AAC: 0
I became a bit more involved with my BA team on the game we're working on this week as I had unfortunately been absent and quite uncommunicative with them the past few weeks :(. We decided to use Unreal Engine 4 to create a Dungeon Crawler which seemed to be based around 1 person's vision and the rest of us had to follow, but I wasn't present to object (although I probably wouldn't have done even if I were). Spent a good amount of time on the website for the interface evaluation this week.

## Week Five
### AS: 3
### AAC: 0
This week was the usability report and essay week work, although the ethics essay wasn't due in yet I started reading around for papers on violence and how DOOM is portrayed by the media, specifically what effect this has on the public. I have definitely been favouring COMP 210 and 230 over 220 just because I don't enjoy COMP220 and I don't understand it. However I intend to meet Brian next week (hopefully) to talk this through with him. 

## Week Six
### AS: 6
### AAC: 1
Interface evaluation out the way! Hopefully I didn't mess the website up too much. This week I worked on the COMP230 essay and have finished writing 1200 words for the essay on DOOM and how people have tried to link it to violent acts and whether or not those acts have any empirical evidence suggesting that it was in fact DOOM that caused it. Brian has gone to Germany so I can't meet with him this week.

## Week Seven
### AS: 7
### AAC: 3
My BA team and I had peer reviews this week to decide how we thought each other were progressing and how they contributed to the team dynamic, I rated them all quite highly and gave minor improvement recommendations to each one. I thought it was a bit unfair as they rated me lowest and the only improvement I could make was "Contribute more" or "Be less shy", which if I could just flick a switch and be more confident then sure I would. Brian suggested I go and learn C++ in my spare time for COMP220, which I intend to do so but wha t spare time? 
At this point I sleep for maybe 8 hours a day, 4 hours are taken up preparing food and other household chores, 6 hours are taken up by lectures and work with the BA team, 2 hours a day on the essay, an hour a day on societal duties. I could squeeze in an hour of C++ a day but then I only get 2 hours of free time. There needs to be more hours in a day :(

## Week Eight
### AS: 8-9
### AAC: 7
Deadline week, I managed to meet all the deadlines on time with hours or days to spare. Only small heart attack I had was when I deleted the submission for COMP220 maths lib to upload the latest repo iteration. However, because my internet at home is astronomically slow this meant I didn't upload the newer iteration to the queue in time. I messaged Michael about this and he replied fairly quickly and said that I had submitted something so I need not panic. Over the past few weeks my anxiety has been getting worse and worse and it's getting to the state of being quite problematic in terms of academic life. I have applied for additional accessibility support and counselling from my GP back home, I don't think the anxiety is course-related.
