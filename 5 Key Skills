# Five key Skills

## Time Management
During this semester my ability to manage all of the modules and personal health and social life equally/fairly has broken down. I am either spending
too long nuturing my social life or too long on trying to force myself to do work, which as resulted in me being physically and emotionally
ill throughout most of uni life. My plan to tackle this, which I have already set in motion, is to write a plan for the next day before
I go to sleep. This usually involves allocating a certain number of hours for each subject area which also eliminates my feeling of
needing to do one or the other. Next term I will have this fully implemented with my daily routine.

## Communication
I'm a shy person who struggles with talking to people due to a lack of confidence and fear of saying something wrong or silly.
Particularly when I'm in a group of people who are friends/living together and I'm the odd one out, this is the case with my BA team.
In the first few weeks I avoided most communication with them, foolishly thinking the problem would go away, and focused on my own work.
Not only has that made everything worse but it also looks bad on me, I aim to fix this by talking to them more about what I'm doing
and being truthful, even if the truth is that I am not working on the game at the current time. My communication skills should improve with them
, and in general, by the middle of next term.

## Motivation
Pushing myself to achieve certain goals is definitely difficult, especially when the pressure isn't on and I can't find a reason that 
benefits me to do it. An example of a lack of motivation ties in with my C++ goal, particularly in COMP220 Graphics & Simulation. I understand
the value of the module but the content still does not interest me, although I do understand not everything is going to interest me.
This goal also partly ties in with communication, but primarily with the lecturer of the module. I left it till week 5 to tell Brian 
that I had no idea what was going on in his module and even now I can't catch up because I'm too far behind. Next term if I don't understand something
I will either speak up in class or, and more likely, speak to the lecturer after class.

## Strategies for emergency situations (anxiety)
I struggle with extreme and acute anxiety, spurred on by irrational thoughts. Always have done and always will, so I need a strategy to deal with this.
I am currently seeking additional medical help from therapists and accessibility which, in theory, should help me come up with some
strategies as to what to do when I have an anxiety attack. As right now, my strategy is to run from everything (not leave my room). 
Ideally, I would like to be going into the third year with a better grasp of my anxiety and more control over it.

## C++ Ability
My only interest in learning C++ is because I'm told that it's what the industry wants and is a very popular skill. Fair enough, but, I was shown
blueprints initially and told that they do most of what C++ can do visually. So, regardless of the fact that being able to use blueprints
is not necessarily as employable (or employable at all) as C++, I still find little reason to make myself learn C++.
That's why I have decided to start work on an independent game over Christmas, possibly with a few friends. This game will be made using C++
which should help me get a better understanding of the programming language. So hopefully when I come back in January I will have at least
basic knowledge of the language.
